	    		<p class="bio">I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Philosophy at Kansas State University.  Previously I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Logic, Langague, and Computation at the University of Amsterdam.</p>

	    		<p class="bio">My research focuses on the foundations of game and decision theory.  In particular, I am interested in connections between evolutionary or learning dynamics and static equilibrium concepts.  Much of my work has involved computer simulations of complex systems.</p>

	    		<p class="bio">I completed my PhD in the Department of Logic and Philosophy of Science at the University of California, Irvine.  I have a BS in Computer Science from Columbia University.</p>

	    		<p class="demo"><a href="bandit-demo/index.html">Network structure and bandit problems</a>
	    			<br> A community of Bayesian learners attempts to learn which arm of a multi-arm slot machine has the greatest payout rate.  How does the community's social structure--i.e., who sees who's payoffs at the slot machine--impact its ability to learn?</p>

	    		<p class="demo"><a href="db-lattice-demo/index.html">Two-strategy games on a lattice</a>
	    			<br> Agents are spatially arrayed on a 2-D grid.  They play a game with their neighbors, and more prosperous players are more likely to spread their strategy type.  What is the system's long-run behavior?</p>

	    		<p class="demo"><a href="dynamic-viz/index.html">A comparison of three learning dynamics in Zeeman's game</a>
	    			<br> Agents are drawn from a large population and paired at random to play a three-strategy game.  How does the population change over time according to three different mean-field learning dynamics?  </p>
